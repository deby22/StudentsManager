1. add restx
2. query params [search] : GET /students without query parameters returns a list of all students; by passing query parameters to GET request (e.g. /students?specialization=Math) returned list should contain only students matching filtration parameters
3. DELETE returns 200
4. Validation (required fields)
5. swagger ui -> restx have it out of the box at all
6. add service layer
7. more test (i dont think test for models of schemas are required in this case)
8. separate test via dirs
